# Groups and Meetings App #

This is a simple app, with users, authentication and authorisation, a secure API, and a front-end, to try out some C# and AWS services.

Plan is to use some AWS services, pecifically, in the short term, Cognito user and identity pools, but also to try and write this
in such a way that it could be deployed in different ways such as using serverless services, or EC2 or even on my laptop.  This probably
means containers.
